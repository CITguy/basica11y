<h1>About</h1>
<p>The primary goal of this site is to write developer guides that focus on building accessible UI patterns.  Instead of bombarding readers with unnecessary specifications, guides are written using simple language (avoiding technical jargon and complex legal terminology) and only include what is needed for a specific UI pattern.  While it is useful for a developer to know how to properly implement video subtitle support for the hard of hearing, this information isn't useful if they're building a Tabset, Accordion, or a menu Button.  Instead, these UI patterns require knowledge of semantic markup, ARIA roles, ARIA properties, and various labeling techniques, while any additional information is just noise.</p>
